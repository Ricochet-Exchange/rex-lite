## What should I know before I get started?

### Ricochet and Packages

Ricochet Exchange Lite is a Single Page Application designed to be fast and reliable, we use the following technologies to build our application.

### Main technologies.

 - **Typescript:**  All files are written in typescript to ensure type safety.
 - **Yarn:**  To avoid bugs please remember to always use yarn, using NPM will cause build errors.
 - **Recharts, React Components:**  UI features should be built following React's functional components standards, any data visualisation should be built with Recharts [React Functional Components](https://react.dev/learn/keeping-components-pure)
 - **Tailwind:**  We use Tailwindcss for our styles, all styles must be written in Tailwind do not use vanilla CSS or modules, the ./tailwind.config.js file has the color themes: [Tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first)
 - **Redux Slices:**  For state management, all external API calls and services should be handled in slices [Read the docs](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/tutorials/overview)
 - **Wagmi/Ethers**  Wagmi for User, Network and Wallet hooks, Ethers for Transactions and contracts **note: we are trying to migrate to using only Wagmi, contributions that follow that will be appreciated**: [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/react/client) [EtherJs](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/)
 - **Superfluid SDK/Superfluid Graph**   Our application relies on the Superfluid SDK to start/stop/edit streams, and retrieve data:  [Read the docs](https://docs.superfluid.finance/superfluid/developers/sdk-core)

### Design Decisions

We have a standard for our application design, the color scheme and general formating will be stored within the theme.ts file in [themes.ts](https://github.com/Seroxdesign/ricochet-app/blob/develop/tailwind.config.js). Please ensure new additions to the UI use the colors and styles declared in this folder.

### Your First Code Contribution

Please notify the team that you will be contributing and what you will be doing to avoid development conflicts.

#### Local development

Ricochet App and all packages can be developed locally.
For instructions on how to do this, see the following sections in the [Get started with Ricochet App locally](https://github.com/Seroxdesign/ricochet-app/blob/develop/README.md)
If you have any trouble drop in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/J22JgwDTVz) and let the core team know what errors you get so we can help you resolve it quickly.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain Ricochet's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in building the best for the community
- Enable a sustainable system for Ricochet's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Create a branch with a title relevant to your contribution please make sure to follow the Dework branch naming convention {username}/{dework taks number}/{dework task title}
2. Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides)
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all checks are passing <details><summary>What if the status checks are failing?</summary>If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated. A maintainer will re-run the status check for you. If we conclude that the failure was a false positive, then we will open an issue to track that problem with our status check suite.</details>
4. Allow the core team time to test and review changes.

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.

## Styleguides

### TypeScript Styleguide

* Prefer the object spread operator (`{...anotherObj}`) to `Object.assign()`
* Inline `export`s with expressions whenever possible
  ```js
  // Use this:
  export default class ClassName {

  }

  // Instead of:
  class ClassName {

  }
  export default ClassName
  ```
* We prefer single tab (2 spaces) for indentation.
* Only use Tailwind for styles, inline styles, module files or alternative UI packages will not be accepted.
* Keep it DRY, avoid repetitive code, and if a function is complex leave comments to help the next contributor.
* Minimize useEffects in code to keep performance up and reduce the complexity of the code.
* If you're in doubt about your code readability, write comments and make it easier for the next contributor.
* Clean code will be appreciated, always aim to keep a file cleaner than you left it.

### Documentation Styleguide

* Use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown).
* Write comments and documentation in clear, concise English.
* Link references if needed.
